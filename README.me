Cheap Flipper, try to bruteforce Excel files but fail anyway !


it actually works... if you're lucky
and well informed


This thing was coded for a friend who needed to find the password of an Excel file that was automatically created through a failed script.
Do NOT use this for shady business, I do not endorse any illegal usage of this script.
